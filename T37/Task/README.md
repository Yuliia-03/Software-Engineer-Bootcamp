### === Your task ==============================================================
Let's have some 'fun'.
Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence and have a brief read 
at what a 'Garden Path sentence' is (at the top) and look at the 'Examples'

Create the file garden.py for this task.
1. Use some Garden Path sentences or think up your own (at least 5).
2. Tokenise and perform Entity recognition for each of the sentences 
after you have stored them in a list called gardenpathSentences.
3. See how spaCy has categorised these sentences and look up the entities you
don't understand
4. At the bottom of your file, write a comment about two unusual entities 
you found that spaCy gave one of the words of your sentences - did you expect this?
